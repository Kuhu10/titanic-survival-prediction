# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a data sience/ machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model uses various features such as age, sex, class, and more to make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. It includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not.

## Model
The model is built using [insert machine learning library or framework, e.g., Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc.]. Various algorithms were tested, and the final model uses [insert algorithm, e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.].
